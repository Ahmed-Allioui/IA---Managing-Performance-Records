IA Assignment 1-2:

a) Please make suitable assumptions on the schema of the two collections.
We had 2 variants:
- first one: using 2 collection (with references)
- second one: using embedded documents
We have chosen embedded documents because its recommended by monogDB Team.
According to mongoDB:
Embedded documents are an efficient and clean way to store related data, especially data that’s regularly accessed together.
In general, when designing schemas for MongoDB, you should prefer embedding by default, and use references and application-side or
database-side joins only when they’re worthwhile. The more often a given workload can retrieve a single document and have all the
data it needs, the more consistently high-performance your application will be.

b) Does the interface of the control class fulfill the CRUD pattern entirely?

Salesman:
- No, Read, Update and Delete are missing. We added them in our project accordingly under the following method names:
- Read: readSalesMan(), readAllSalesMen()
- Update: updateSalesMan()
- Delete: deleteSalesMan(), deleteAllSalesMen()

EvaluationRecord:
- No, Create, Update and Delete. We added them in our project accordingly under the following method names:
- Create: addPerformanceRecord()
- Update: updatePerformanceRecord()
- Delete: deletePerformanceRecord()
